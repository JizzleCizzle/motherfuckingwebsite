      <h1>This is a motherfreaking website.</h1>
      <aside>And it's freaking perfect.</aside>

    <h2>Seriously, what the duck else do you want?</h2>
    <p>You probably build websites and think your shit is special. You think
      your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some freaking
      Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your
      40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally
      has box-shadow. Wrong, motherducker. Let me describe your perfect-ass
      website:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shit's lightweight and loads fast</li>
      <li>Fits on all your shitty screens</li>
      <li>Looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
      <li>The motherbucker's accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
      <li>Shit's legible and gets your freaking point across (if you had one
        instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Well guess what, mothertrucker:</h3>
    <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a motherfreaking
      website. Why the duck do you need to animate a freaking trendy-ass banner
      flag when I hover over that useless piece of shit? You spent hours on it
      and added 80 kilobytes to your freaking site, and some motherducker jabbing
      at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that shit. Not
      to mention blind people will never see that shit, but they don't see any
      of your shitty shit.</p>
    <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>
    <h2>It's freaking lightweight</h2>
    <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on
      your freaking Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI
      just so you could animate the freaking background color of a div? You
      loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shitty webfont just so you could say "Hi." at
      100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of shit.</p>
    <h2>It's responsive</h2>
    <p>You dumbass. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but
      no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever motherfreaking screensize
      it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a
      motherfreaking Tamagotchi.</p>
    <h2>It freaking works</h2>
    <p>Look at this shit. You can read it ... that is, if you can read,
      mothertrucker. It makes sense. It has motherfreaking hierarchy. It's using
      HTML5 tags so you and your bitch-ass browser know what the buck's in this
      freaking site. That's semantics, mothertrucker.</p>
    <p>It has content on the freaking screen. Your site has three bylines and
      link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and
      make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo
      plugin is.</p>
    <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this mothertrucker in IE6. I freaking
      dare you.</p>
    <h2>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h2>
    <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true
      natural state is, you have no freaking idea what a website is. All you have
      ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text
      communicating a freaking message. This is a real, naked website. Look at
      it. It's freaking beautiful.</p>
    <h3>Yes, this is freaking satire, you duck</h3>
    <p>I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like this. What I'm
      saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <strong>ones we
        create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by default, they are
      functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You
      son-of-a-bitch.</p>

      websites.</p>
